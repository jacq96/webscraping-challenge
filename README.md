# webscraping-challenge
12/15/2023- I did reach out to Tyler via email for assistance with a fix that had given for using Selenium instead of Splinter as it wasn't working for most of us.
Occasional errors that I couldn't diagnose myself were fixed by using ChatGPT. 
Otherwise consulted previous class materials from activities to work through coding struggles. 
Googled the amount of Earth days that are in a Martian year to have a reference point.
